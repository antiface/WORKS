### WORKS
* For the moment, in each of the subfolders in this repository, you will find subfolders for each year of production within a given decade, either the 1990s or the 2000s for now;
* It is important to note that for the moment, the lists of documents produced in each given year are not complete;
* I have the complete lists, I'm just starting with documents that are most related to what I am doing today as an artist;
* All of the documents will be added in time, it's just that for brevity's sake, I am starting with what is currently, or seems to currently be the most pertinent works;
* This is evidently an ongoing process and will take some time to complete;
* In the end, you will not only have complete lists of all textual productions, and eventually visual and audio/sound/musical productions as well, but you will actually have a repository, a kind of database if you will, of each of the actual individual works, for your viewing pleasure;
* Please stay tuned... (and no, unfortunately none of it will be released into the Public Domain. It will ALL remain All Rights Reserved, A.G. (c) 2016 until further notice).
