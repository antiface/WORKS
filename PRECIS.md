### PRECIS ON PATH FORWARD - ARCHIVES-PROJECT, PERSONAL CORPUS
* The first step in this process, which I have already begun, is to put all of my written documents (digital) in one place;
* After that, I will need to "clean" them up, i.e. put everything in text format (.txt) or other formats I might need them to be in;
* After that, I will be starting by looking at what the possibilities might be in Python using NLTK, to create concordances and the rest;
* The goal is simple, I want to do a simple and very general exploratory analysis of my written content over the last 20 years;
* That is to say, I am doing this first of all as part of my @20YearsOfData Project; secondly, I want to do an exploratory analysis, meaning that I don't know what I am looking for yet; I will find it as I go along;
* Therefore, there is not specific goal or objective here; any progress is good progress;
