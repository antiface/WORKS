### PRECIS ON PATH FORWARD - ARCHIVES-PROJECT, PERSONAL CORPUS
* The first step in this process, which I have already begun, is to put all of my written documents (digital) in one place;
* After that, I will need to "clean" them up, i.e. put everything in text format (.txt) or other formats I might need them to be in;
* After that, I will be starting by looking at what the possibilities might be in Python using NLTK, to create concordances and the rest;
* The goal is simple, I want to do a simple and very general exploratory analysis of my written content over the last 20 years;
* That is to say, I am doing this first of all as part of my @20YearsOfData Project; secondly, I want to do an exploratory analysis, meaning that I don't know what I am looking for yet; I will find it as I go along;
* Therefore, there is not specific goal or objective here; any progress is good progress;
* The idea, then, is to try to gain insight into my own corpus;
* After having put all my writings into .txt format, and after having "massaged" the data properly, I will begin analyzing the content;
* I will do word counts, statistical analyses of word frequency distributions;
* I will also try to find which terms tend to to be found together;
* In essence, I want to treat my entire digital textual output over the last 20 years as a kind of "time series";
* That is, I want to look at 20 years of textual data as an ongoing process, a daily process, and my writing itself as a SYSTEM;
* I want to study my CORPUS-AS-SYSTEM and describe its dynamical behavior over time (over the past 20 years);
